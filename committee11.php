this increased power will certainly facilitate a higher level of discussion and yield some powerful and impactful decisions.                                 The WPC brings together private entities, national oil corporations, media representatives, NGOs,                                 environmental lobbyists and other bodies from many nations and is thus a powerful forum for multi-sectoral collaboration.                                 At the same time, however, the vastly varied interests of different countries,                                 companies, and non- government entities will undoubtedly give rise to tensions within the committee when faced with crises.                                 The committee will have to work together to confront issues from the from the future of oil companies in                                 the face of a global thrust towards clean energy to complex political crises                                and instabilities impacting petroleum markets and to the development of breakthrough but potentially dangerous energy technologies.                                 As delegates representing these various corporate, political, and other entities, your job will be to further your own agendas;                                 whether these involve maximizing profits, corporate espionage, increasing domestic government popularity, initiating trade wars,                                 developing nuclear energy, preventing environmental degradation, or anything else.                                 In order to succeed in this committee, substantial knowledge of the workings of the global oil markets, historical oil crises,                                 technological innovations in relation to oil and energy, and more is recommended.                                 We look forward to a fast-paced committee unafraid to tackle a range of crises.                            </p>                        </div>                    </div>                </div>                <div class = "clear">                </div>            </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
