Fought between a                                 rising superpower against the previously dominant power, the rise of Athens made                                 war in Thucydides' estimation,''inevitabl''. A war both sides believed they could win                                 quickly and fought for ideology as much as for geopolitics, within a generation it had                                 brought horrors unseen in Greece even during the Persian invasions, such as plague                                 and famine. A war for the destiny of Greece, it brought epochal change to Greek                                 civilization and marked the end of its golden age. This committee will be comprised of                                 delegates from the Delian League as they attempt to survive the Peloponnesian attack                                 and ensure the security of their city-states for the next generation. With overwhelming                                 sea power, a zeal for democracy and an unwieldy coalition more afraid of Sparta than                                 loyal to Athens, delegates will have to maintain political solidarity, set the objectives for                                 the war and ultimately claim victory in a conflict that pits the two Greek superpowers                                 of the age against one another. The city-states of the Delian League must judge the                                 long term survival of their polities above all else, and only enter this war believing that                                 Spartan hegemony would spell their enslavement. It will be the work of the delegates                                 assembled to both work towards a united alliance while maintaining their own security.                                 The committee will open in 431 on the eve of the very first Spartan invasion of Attica.                                 Delegates should come prepared to fight a war like no other.                                                        </p>                        </div>                    </div>                </div>                <div class = "clear">                </div>            </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
