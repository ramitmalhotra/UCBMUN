Seedy opium dens, dark alleys, rampant prostitution, and bloody guerilla warfare are the defining features of San Francisco's Chinatown.                             This was not always the case: fleeing from violence and persecution in the mines during the 1850s Gold Rush,                             Chinese immigrants sought refuge in San Francisco, forming a quiet community in the heart of the city.                             Within a few decades, however, the Chinese found themselves entrapped not only by a discriminatory government,                             but also by their fellow neighbors, as vicious gang warfare ensnared the alleys and rooftops of Chinatown.                             Although the tong gangs formed with harmless intentions of collective protection for their fellow                             countrymen, the committee will discover that the illicit markets of Chinatown are a much more lucrative business-although running gambling,                             prostitution, and opium rackets is risky business, especially when your rivals are out to separate your head with a hatchet. From the                             boo how doy to the corrupt contacts inside of City Hall, delegates will be responsible for ensuring the dominance of the Chee Kong Tong by                             any means necessary. Rival gangs, the San Francisco police, concerned missionaries, and a terrified community lurk at every turn, seeking                             to bring about your downfall. Shady deals, intimidation, image control, betrayal, and above all, outsmarting the opposition will be vital                             if the Chee Kong is to survive. As committee will be situated near the heart of where the battles took place and blood flowed, delegates                             will have the unique opportunity to battle for dominance as they relive one of the darkest and most complex eras in San Francisco's history.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                </div>                <div class = "clear">                </div>            </div>            </div>        </div>    </body></html>
